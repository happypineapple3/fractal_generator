# Software Development Plan

## Phase 0: Requirements Analysis (tag name `5.1-analyzed`)
*(20% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

*   [X] Re-write the instructions in your own words.
    *   If you don't do this, you won't know what you're supposed to do!
    *   Don't leave out details!
## Rewrite the instructions
    * The goal of this assignment is to create a fractal-imaging program that takes its data from files rather than hard-coded data. In this sense, it's more flexible than the previous assignment. It's also supposed to provide at least four different fractal types/classes (the typing is based off the iteration count) as well as at least two palette sublasses derived from a Palette absstract class. This will allow the program to create more complex fractals. In terms of program requirements, the code will consist of a variety of classes and functions:
        * A Fractal abstract class with at least four concrete Fractal sublcasses
        * A FractalFactory function (inside its own module) that returns a Fractal object based off a configuration file
        * A FractalParser module that reads a file from the command line and returns the configuration file to be used by FractalFactory
            * This module will also have a function that safely converts data types into the data types needed by FractalFactory to create a fractal
        * A Palette abstract class with at least two concrete subclasses
            * At least one must be dynamically generated at runtime
        * a FaletteFactory module with a function that returns a Palette object
        * An ImagePainter class that takes the product of FractalFactory, PaletteFactory, and FractalParser as input and creates an instance of ImagePainter
        * main.py where the commands are given and an ImagePainter object is made
    * I'm also supposed to be as specific as I can with any error messages, making note of where the program failed and alerting the user about it.
    * Nothing about the program should be hardcoded. It should get all of its information from the files provided by the user
        * The only exception to this is if the user doesn't provide a file or a fractal name. In this case, there is a default fractal that will be hardcoded and printed out.


*   [X] Explain the problem this program aims to solve.
## What this program aims to solve
    * The purpose of this program is to be able to print out a fractal image based off a file of fractal information that is provided by the user. Unlike the 5.0 assignment, none of the information is hardcoded into the program (with the exception of a default fractal). It should be able to take any configuration, provided that it has the right information.

    *   Describe what a *good* solution looks like.
### A good solution
    * A good solution for this assignment is a program whose modules/classes are clearly defined and clearly separated. Some modules don't need to know what's going on in other ones, so it will be important to write the code properly so that there are no unncecessary steps. Each module has one purpose and each one achieves that purpose with only the required information. A good solution also smoothly handles errors. There are a lot of places where things could go wrong, so it's important that the program account for each way an error could occur and provide enough information about the error so that the user will know what went wrong and how to fix it.

    *   List what you already know how to do.
### What I already know how to do
    * I feel comfortable using classes and initializing objects, so I'm not to worried about that aspect of the assignment
    * I know how to make for Fractal subclasses by changing the count iteration functions
    * From assignment 5.0, I know how a Fractal is actually made using tKinter
    * I understand the role that Palettes play in the process of making a Fractal image 

    *   Point out any challenges that you can foresee.
### Challenges I can forsee
    * There are a lot of moving parts, so I think that it'll take some time to get the program to actually work and then optimize it
    * I don't yet understand how to make a dynamic Palette by importing 'Colour'
    * Because there are so many ways for the program to go wrong, it will be difficult accounting for every error that the user could make. I will have to be thorough in this step.
    * Even though I've done several assignments where I've had to read a file provided by the user, I just know I'll need some time to figure that out and make sure my program reads it like it's supposed to.


*   [X] List all of the data that is used by the program, making note of where it comes from.
### Data used by the program
    * Almost all of the data should come from a file provided by the user. This file will have all the fractal configuration data (the name, type, center x and y, axis length, pixels, iterations, and an optional creal value). The program will know what to do with that information. It will have functions to provide the iteration count for the fractal types, and then the program will have the color palettes that are chosen by the user. This is all the data that will be used in the program.

    *   Explain what form the output will take.
### Form of the output
    * The output will be an tKinter image of a fractal. The program will also print a progress bar to the terminal as well as the name of the file that it's saving the image to. If an error occurs, details of the error will be pritned out to the user.


*   [X] List the algorithms that will be used (but don't write them yet).
## Algorithms that will be used
    * Each fractal class will have a function that returns the iteration count of a fractal
    * FractalFactory will need a function to read the fractal configuration data and return a Fractal as a result
    * FractalParser will need a funtion to read a file and save certain data while ignoring other data
        * There will also be a function that converts data types into other data types
    * At least one of the Palettle classes will need a function to generate the Palette and runtime
        * All Palette classes will need a function to return a string at a specified index
    * PaletteFactory will need a function to instantiate a Palette object
    * ImagePainter will need a function to take the data provided some of the other classes/modules and then make an image based off that data
    * main.py will need functions to read the command line and act accordingly
    * Each module will need to include room for wherever any errors could occur.
