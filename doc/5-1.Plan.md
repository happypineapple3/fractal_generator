# Software Development Plan

## Phase 0: Requirements Analysis (tag name `5.1-analyzed`)
*(20% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

*   [X] Re-write the instructions in your own words.
    *   If you don't do this, you won't know what you're supposed to do!
    *   Don't leave out details!
## Rewrite the instructions
    * The goal of this assignment is to create a fractal-imaging program that takes its data from files rather than hard-coded data. In this sense, it's more flexible than the previous assignment. It's also supposed to provide at least four different fractal types/classes (the typing is based off the iteration count) as well as at least two palette sublasses derived from a Palette absstract class. This will allow the program to create more complex fractals. In terms of program requirements, the code will consist of a variety of classes and functions:
        * A Fractal abstract class with at least four concrete Fractal sublcasses
        * A FractalFactory function (inside its own module) that returns a Fractal object based off a configuration file
        * A FractalParser function (inside its own module) that reads a file from the command line and returns the configuration file to be used by FractalFactory
            * This module will also have a function that safely converts data types into the data types needed by FractalFactory to create a fractal
        * A Palette abstract class with at least two concrete subclasses
            * At least one must be dynamically generated at runtime
        * a FaletteFactory module with a function that returns a Palette object
        * An ImagePainter class that takes the product of FractalFactory, PaletteFactory, and FractalParser as input and creates an instance of ImagePainter
        * main.py where the commands are given and an ImagePainter object is made
    * I'm also supposed to be as specific as I can with any error messages, making note of where the program failed and alerting the user about it.
    * Nothing about the program should be hardcoded. It should get all of its information from the files provided by the user
        * The only exception to this is if the user doesn't provide a file or a fractal name. In this case, there is a default fractal that will be hardcoded and printed out.


*   [X] Explain the problem this program aims to solve.
## What this program aims to solve
    * The purpose of this program is to be able to print out a fractal image based off a file of fractal information that is provided by the user. Unlike the 5.0 assignment, none of the information is hardcoded into the program (with the exception of a default fractal). It should be able to take any configuration, provided that it has the right information.

    *   Describe what a *good* solution looks like.
### A good solution
    * A good solution for this assignment is a program whose modules/classes are clearly defined and clearly separated. Some modules don't need to know what's going on in other ones, so it will be important to write the code properly so that there are no unncecessary steps. Each module has one purpose and each one achieves that purpose with only the required information. A good solution also smoothly handles errors. There are a lot of places where things could go wrong, so it's important that the program account for each way an error could occur and provide enough information about the error so that the user will know what went wrong and how to fix it.

    *   List what you already know how to do.
### What I already know how to do
    * I feel comfortable using classes and initializing objects, so I'm not to worried about that aspect of the assignment
    * I know how to make for Fractal subclasses by changing the count iteration functions
    * From assignment 5.0, I know how a Fractal is actually made using tKinter
    * I understand the role that Palettes play in the process of making a Fractal image 

    *   Point out any challenges that you can foresee.
### Challenges I can forsee
    * There are a lot of moving parts, so I think that it'll take some time to get the program to actually work and then optimize it
    * I don't yet understand how to make a dynamic Palette by importing 'Colour'
    * Because there are so many ways for the program to go wrong, it will be difficult accounting for every error that the user could make. I will have to be thorough in this step.
    * Even though I've done several assignments where I've had to read a file provided by the user, I just know I'll need some time to figure that out and make sure my program reads it like it's supposed to.


*   [X] List all of the data that is used by the program, making note of where it comes from.
### Data used by the program
    * Almost all of the data should come from a file provided by the user. This file will have all the fractal configuration data (the name, type, center x and y, axis length, pixels, iterations, and an optional creal value). The program will know what to do with that information. It will have functions to provide the iteration count for the fractal types, and then the program will have the color palettes that are chosen by the user. This is all the data that will be used in the program.

    *   Explain what form the output will take.
### Form of the output
    * The output will be an tKinter image of a fractal. The program will also print a progress bar to the terminal as well as the name of the file that it's saving the image to. If an error occurs, details of the error will be pritned out to the user.


*   [X] List the algorithms that will be used (but don't write them yet).
## Algorithms that will be used
    * Each fractal class will have a function that returns the iteration count of a fractal
    * FractalFactory will need a function to read the fractal configuration data and return a Fractal as a result
    * FractalParser will need a funtion to read a file and save certain data while ignoring other data
        * There will also be a function that converts data types into other data types
    * At least one of the Palettle classes will need a function to generate the Palette and runtime
        * All Palette classes will need a function to return a string at a specified index
    * PaletteFactory will need a function to instantiate a Palette object
    * ImagePainter will need a function to take the data provided some of the other classes/modules and then make an image based off that data
    * main.py will need functions to read the command line and act accordingly
    * Each module will need to include room for wherever any errors could occur.


*   [X] Tag the last commit in this phase `analyzed`
    *   *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed by midnight on the Sunday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*


## Phase 1: Design (tag name `5.1-designed`)
*(30% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

*   [X] Function signatures that include:
    *   Descriptive names.
    *   Parameter lists.
    *   Documentation strings that explain its purpose and types of inputs and outputs.
## Function signatures

* class Fractal:
    def count(coordinate, max_iter):
        The Fractal class is the main abstract class that all the other Fractals are derived from. Every Fractal needs its own count method, so this one should be left blank to make sure that each Fractal overrides it. 'coordinate' is a number on the complex plane, and 'max_iter' (type int) is the maximum number of iterations the function should run. The function will return the number of iterations necessary generate a value greater than 2.0 OR the max_iter if this condition is never met. This return value will also be returned as an integer. Every subclass of Fractal will have the same function purpose and parameters.


* class Phoenix(Fractal):
    def count(coordinates, max_iter):
        see 'class Fractal'

* class Mandelbrot(Fractal):
    def count(coordinates, max_iter):
        see 'class Fractal'

* class Julia(Fractal):
    def count(coordinates, max_iter):
        see 'class Fractal'

* class Spider(Fractal):
    def count(coordinates, max_iter):
        see 'class Fractal'

* class BurningShip(Fractal):
    def count(coordinates, max_iter):
        see 'class Fractal'    

* def makeFractal(fractalInfo):
    This function belongs in its own module that will be called 'FractalFactory'. It's purpose is to instantiate a Fractal object based on fractalInfo, or the fractal configuration data. 'fractalInfo' is obtained on the command line from the user. This function takes that data and returns one of the Fractal subclasses. If 'fractalInfo' is not provided, then makeFractal produces a default Fractal with hard-coded data.

* def fractalParser(fracFile):
    This function takes the fractal configuration file ('fracFile') from the command line and parses it for information, storing the important elements into a dictionary. Before it stores each piece of data, it safely converts it from a string to the necessary type. This dictionary is what is then used by makeFractal.

* class Palette:
    def getColor(n):
        This is the Palette abstract class. All other Palette classes will be derived from this class, and each subclass will need to define its own getColor method. 'getColor' will take an intenger (n) and return its corresponding list index. This return value will be a string of a color written in hex form.

* class Dynamic(Palette):
    see 'class Palette'
    This will be a Palette that is dynamically generated using the 'Colour' module.

* class Static(Palette)
    see 'class Palette'
    This will be a predefined list of colors

* class ImagePainter:
    This class takes the products of FractalFactory, PaletteFactory, and FractalParser to print out a Fractal image


*   [X] Pseudocode that captures how each function works.
    *   Pseudocode != source code.  Do not paste your finished source code into this part of the plan.
## Pseudocode

```
class Phoenix:
    def count(coordinates, max_iter):
        set the c and phoenix constants to their values
        set the previous value of 'z' to (0,0j)
        flip the imaginary and real parts of the 'coordinates'
        for i in range of max_iter
            compute the new value of z
            if the value is greater than 2.0: return i
        return max_iter
```
```
class Mandelbrot:
    def count(coordinates, max_iter):
        set z equal to (0,0j)
        for i in range of max_iter:
            compute the new value of z
            if the value is greater than 2.0: return i
        return max_iter
```
```
class Julia:
    def count(coordinates, max_iter):
        set z to a point on the complex plain
        c is set to an arbitrary complex number and will remain unchanged
        for i in range of max_iter:
            compute the new value of z
            if the new value is greater than 2.0: return i
        return i
```
```
class Spider:
    def count(coordinates, max_iter):
        c is initialized to a point on the complex plane
        set z equal to (0,0j)
            for i in range of max_iter:
                update z
                update c
                if z is greater than 2.0: return i
            return i
```
```
class BurningShip:
    def count(coordinates, max_iter):
        c is a point on the complex plane
        set z equal to (0,0j)
        for i in range of max_iter:
            update the new z value
            if z is greater than 2.0: return i
        return i
```
```
def makeFractal(fracalInfo):
    if there is fractalInfo:
        instantiate a Fractal object based on the fractalInfo
    else:
        instantiate a default Fractal object
```
```
def fractalParser(fracFile):
    create an empty dictionary
    open the file given in the command line
    read the file on line at a time
    ignore any lines that are blank or have #'s in them
    when a valid line is read, separate into two parts; make the word the key and convert the other part into its corresponding data type as the key's value
    Once the file is done being read, close it.
    Return the dictionary
```
```
def getColor(n):
    return the value of the list at index 'n'
```


*   Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.
    *   Write a few specific examples that occur to you, and use them later when testing
## In the face of good and bad input
* In the event that everything runs perfectly, the program will print out a picture of whatever fractal the user gave in the command line argument. Each function will work as it should, and we would see polymorphism in action. The image would print out, and then wait for the user to close it once it finished printing. If the user does not provide any input, then the function will still work. It will simply produce a default fractal, but that will not change anything about how the program runs.
* If the program encounters faulty data at any part of the process, then it will crash, but it will provide an error message as specific as can be. For example, if the fractalParser method stored an invalid piece of information for a fractal, the program will crash and point the user towards that specific piece of information that made the program crash.
    * I will want to test this for every piece of the fractalParser to make sure that every error messasge prints out as it should. I will also provide the name of a Palette without a file to make sure that the program crashes, which is what it should do.
